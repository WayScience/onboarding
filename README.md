# Welcome to the Way Lab!

This repository includes our mission statement, lab policies, expectations, standards, and important documents required to be a successful member of the Way Lab.

Please read this document in full, and please suggest any changes to this living document.

## Our mission

The Way Labâ€™s mission is to integrate high-dimensional biomedical data science into clinical decision-making.
We are biologists who strive to reduce human suffering.
We use biomedical data science and computational biology to develop and validate analytical methods, novel approaches, and software.
And, in select high-impact collaborations, we use team science to apply our methods and know-how to help advance clinical understanding, patient treatment strategies, and drug discovery.

We value creativity, integrity, courage, and openness.
We believe that to maximize our impact, we require outside-the-box thinking and new perspectives.
We will embrace new technologies, trust the data, learn from all of our experiences, and radically support each other.
We use open science to the fullest extent in every project we pursue, and we are passionate about computational reproducibility.
We also value our time away from the lab, doing whatever else gives us joy.

Our goal is to provide health systems and doctors with easy access to rich, patient-specific, clinically-actionable information.
We will primarily focus on cancer research in our internal projects, and we will pursue collaborations in multiple disease areas of need.
People of all ages and demographics who suffer from cancer will know how their individual tumors (and their healthy cells) will respond to various treatments.
To get there, we will establish morphology as a systems biology measurement rivaling molecular readouts in mechanistic information content.
We will understand, with greater detail, how the central dogma of biology links and interacts with other, higher-order biological manifestations, like morphology.

As research capabilities evolve, new approaches crystalize, and the most pressing problems of tomorrow manifest, we will be ready.

## Expectations

Everyone is expected to be present during core business hours, between 10am - 4pm, at least four days a week.
In addition to the core hours, we expect you to work 40 hours per week.
However, in rare occasions, working extra time becomes necessary to meet deadlines.
If you are consistently working far more or far fewer hours per week, please consider rethinking your behaviors and motivations, and consider working with the PI, or other lab members, to establish personalized healthy behaviors.
During the pandemic, we will follow all guidelines as set forth by the University in regards to remote work.

Imposter syndrome is real, and everyone experiences it at some point.
When you ultimately experience this, you must remember that you belong.
Research is hard and can be frustrating at times, but it is also extremely rewarding and can have real impact in our world.
You will persevere through the hard times and celebrate the good times.
You strive to be a supportive member of all communities you are a part of.

Everyone has a voice, and we will listen.

### Roles

**Principal Investigator**
The PI will participate in all lab functions and adhere to the lab's core values.
The PI will decide the research agenda, apply for grants, discover collaborations, and help establish (and abide by) a culture in which everyone in the lab feels safe and can effectively contribute to the overall lab's mission.
In consultation with each lab member, the PI will assign research projects, help define both research and career-oriented goals, track progress, and provide guidance when necessary.

**Staff Scientists**
Every staff scientist is expected to participate in all lab functions and adhere to the lab's core values.
You will lead multiple research projects, communicate with collaborators, present research in progress at strategy meetings, and work with the PI to define your own overall research agenda.

**Postdoc Scientists**
Every postdoc is expected to participate in all lab functions and adhere to the lab's core values.
Following a predefined schedule set forth at the beginning of each semester, you will present at least one journal club and one research in progress during lab meeting.
You will work with the PI to design your own research program that aligns the lab's overall mission with your personal and career goals.
If desired, you will mentor other lab members on research projects, and write your own grants.
A postdoc is a temporary position, and ends when you find your next position.

**Graduate Students**
Every graduate student is expected to participate in all lab functions and adhere to the lab's core values.
If you are taking classes, we strongly encourage you to spend the time between classes in the lab.
It is ok to do homework during lab time, but remember that part of the graduate school experience is juggling obligations and improving time management.
You will abide by the guidelines set forth by your graduate program.
Following a predefined schedule set forth at the beginning of each semester, you will present at least one journal club and one research in progress during lab meeting.
You will work with the PI to establish your own research program, define and track personalized career-goals, and communicate any concerns.
